# pomodoro timer
Simple pomodoro timer using stm32f103 bluepill, leds and buttons. I'm learning some low-level programming using STM32 dev boards. This project is using: Timers, GPIOs, Interrupts, and some low-level bit shifting. It makes me used to binary numbers.

## Prerequisites
To be able to run this thing you'll need:
- a STM32F103C8T6 board,
- 6 LED's,
- preferably some 220Ohm resistors to connect with LED's,
- a pushbutton for resetting the timer

## To-do
- [X] Initial program,
- [ ] Add more buttons (preferably mechanical switches) to set the timer period,
- [ ] Add some small resistors,
- [ ] Solder brass stand and make it prettier,
- [ ] PCB if brass won't work out,
- [ ] Maybe 7-segment display.
